# React H5 Audio Player

* Audio player component that provides consistent UI on different browsers.

* Flexbox design with CSS shapes. Mobile friendly. No extra dependencies.

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge, IE (â‰¥10)

### Breaking change from 0.x to 1.x

In 1.x, we use `prop-types` package instead of using it directly in React. Thus we dropped support under `react@15.5.0`. The usage will remain the same.

## Installation

`npm i --save react-h5-audio-player`

## Usage

```jsx
import AudioPlayer from "react-h5-audio-player";

const Player = () => (
  <AudioPlayer
    autoPlay
    src="http://example.com/audio.mp3"
    onPlay={e => console.log("onPlay")}
    // other props here
  />
);
```

## Props

### HTML Audio Tag Native Attributes

## UI Overwrites

React H5 Audio Player provides built-in class names for developers to overwrite.

For example:

```sass
// In a SASS or LESS file
.react-h5-audio-player {
  .toggle-play-wrapper {
    .toggle-play-button {
      // Remember to use !important to overwrite inline styles.
      background-color: red !important;
    }
  }
}
```

You can find more class names by inspecting element on you browser.

To be compatible with some **old browsers**, you can add prefixers to flex container

```sass
.react-h5-audio-player {
  .flex {
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: flex;
    .toggle-play-wrapper {
      flex: 1 0 60px;
      -webkit-box-flex: 1 0 60px;
      -moz-box-flex: 1 0 60px;
      -ms-flex: 1 0 60px;
    }
    .progress-bar-wrapper {
      flex: 10 0 auto;
      -webkit-box-flex: 10 0 auto;
      -moz-box-flex: 10 0 auto;
      -ms-flex: 10 0 auto;
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Access to the audio element

You can get direct access to the underlying audio element. First get a ref to ReactAudioPlayer:

```jsx
<ReactAudioPlayer ref={c => (this.player = c)} />
```

Then you can access the audio element like this:

`this.player.audio`
